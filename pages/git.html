            <h2>Description</h2>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Git</strong> is a an open source distributed version control system that is available for free
                under
                the GNU General Public License version 2. The Git source code is hosted on GitHub, from where it can be
                downloaded or installed. Users can also utilize one of the binary installers to deploy Git on their
                systems.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Git</strong> is used primarily by developers to manage their source code. Git records changes to
                files over time,
                while ensuring the integrity of those changes at each stage of processing. Users can revert to earlier
                versions and compare different versions at the file level. They can also branch and merge files to
                support
                independent development efforts and nonlinear workflows.</p>
